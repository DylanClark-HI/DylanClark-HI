- 👋 Hi, I’m @DylanClark-HI
- 👀 I’m interested in learning lots of new stuff. I very much like the idea of automated testing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about what exactly a 'stack' is and how to implement different tools. I'm working a lot with Cypress automated testing stuff. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing just yet.
