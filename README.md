- 👋 Hi, I’m @DylanClark-HI
- 👀 I’m currently 4+ years into my career as a full-stack developer.
- 👨‍💻 I have a passion for embedded systems, IoT, microcontrollers, and automation. I spend most of my free time tinkering with electronics and ICs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular, PHP, Python, C#, some nifty SCSS tricks, MySql, and JS. All the usual tools needed for full-stack work!
- 🎮 As for my hobbies, I'm currently learning about Machine Communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C, etc), Analog Digital Converters, Data Loggers, and various analogue and digital sensor inputs. 
- 🔩 I also enjoy functional 3D design. Mostly designs for 3D printed electronics enclosures, and editing designs to suit my needs. Nothing fancy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing just yet. But maybe some sort of IoT project soon.
